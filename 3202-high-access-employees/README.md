<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/high-access-employees">3202. High-Access Employees</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><p>You are given a 2D <strong>0-indexed</strong> array of strings, <code>access_times</code>, with size <code>n</code>. For each <code>i</code> where <code>0 &lt;= i &lt;= n - 1</code>, <code>access_times[i][0]</code> represents the name of an employee, and <code>access_times[i][1]</code> represents the access time of that employee. All entries in <code>access_times</code> are within the same day.</p>

<p>The access time is represented as <strong>four digits</strong> using a <strong>24-hour</strong> time format, for example, <code>&quot;0800&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;2250&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>An employee is said to be <strong>high-access</strong> if he has accessed the system <strong>three or more</strong> times within a <strong>one-hour period</strong>.</p>

<p>Times with exactly one hour of difference are <strong>not</strong> considered part of the same one-hour period. For example, <code>&quot;0815&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;0915&quot;</code> are not part of the same one-hour period.</p>

<p>Access times at the start and end of the day are <strong>not</strong> counted within the same one-hour period. For example, <code>&quot;0005&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;2350&quot;</code> are not part of the same one-hour period.</p>

<p>Return <em>a list that contains the names of <strong>high-access</strong> employees with any order you want.</em></p>

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> access_times = [[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;0549&quot;],[&quot;b&quot;,&quot;0457&quot;],[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;0532&quot;],[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;0621&quot;],[&quot;b&quot;,&quot;0540&quot;]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [&quot;a&quot;]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> &quot;a&quot; has three access times in the one-hour period of [05:32, 06:31] which are 05:32, 05:49, and 06:21.
But &quot;b&quot; does not have more than two access times at all.
So the answer is [&quot;a&quot;].</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> access_times = [[&quot;d&quot;,&quot;0002&quot;],[&quot;c&quot;,&quot;0808&quot;],[&quot;c&quot;,&quot;0829&quot;],[&quot;e&quot;,&quot;0215&quot;],[&quot;d&quot;,&quot;1508&quot;],[&quot;d&quot;,&quot;1444&quot;],[&quot;d&quot;,&quot;1410&quot;],[&quot;c&quot;,&quot;0809&quot;]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> &quot;c&quot; has three access times in the one-hour period of [08:08, 09:07] which are 08:08, 08:09, and 08:29.
&quot;d&quot; has also three access times in the one-hour period of [14:10, 15:09] which are 14:10, 14:44, and 15:08.
However, &quot;e&quot; has just one access time, so it can not be in the answer and the final answer is [&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;].</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> access_times = [[&quot;cd&quot;,&quot;1025&quot;],[&quot;ab&quot;,&quot;1025&quot;],[&quot;cd&quot;,&quot;1046&quot;],[&quot;cd&quot;,&quot;1055&quot;],[&quot;ab&quot;,&quot;1124&quot;],[&quot;ab&quot;,&quot;1120&quot;]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [&quot;ab&quot;,&quot;cd&quot;]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> &quot;ab&quot; has three access times in the one-hour period of [10:25, 11:24] which are 10:25, 11:20, and 11:24.
&quot;cd&quot; has also three access times in the one-hour period of [10:25, 11:24] which are 10:25, 10:46, and 10:55.
So the answer is [&quot;ab&quot;,&quot;cd&quot;].</pre>
