2244. Minimum Rounds to Complete All Tasks</h2><hr><div><p>You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>tasks</code>, where <code>tasks[i]</code> represents the difficulty level of a task. In each round, you can complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the <strong>same difficulty level</strong>.</p>

<p>Return <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> rounds required to complete all the tasks, or </em><code>-1</code><em> if it is not possible to complete all the tasks.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> tasks = [2,2,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> To complete all the tasks, a possible plan is:
- In the first round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 2. 
- In the second round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 3. 
- In the third round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 4. 
- In the fourth round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 4.  
It can be shown that all the tasks cannot be completed in fewer than 4 rounds, so the answer is 4.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> tasks = [2,3,3]
<strong>Output:</strong> -1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There is only 1 task of difficulty level 2, but in each round, you can only complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the same difficulty level. Hence, you cannot complete all the tasks, and the answer is -1.
</pre>

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= tasks.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= tasks[i] &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code></li>
</ul>
