<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/swim-in-rising-water">794. Swim in Rising Water</a></h2><h3>Hard</h3><hr><p>You are given an <code>n x n</code> integer matrix <code>grid</code> where each value <code>grid[i][j]</code> represents the elevation at that point <code>(i, j)</code>.</p>

<p>It starts raining, and water gradually rises over time. At time <code>t</code>, the water level is <code>t</code>, meaning <strong>any</strong> cell with elevation less than equal to <code>t</code> is submerged or reachable.</p>

<p>You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most <code>t</code>. You can swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.</p>

<p>Return <em>the minimum time until you can reach the bottom right square </em><code>(n - 1, n - 1)</code><em> if you start at the top left square </em><code>(0, 0)</code>.</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> grid = [[0,2],[1,3]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
Explanation:
At time 0, you are in grid location (0, 0).
You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.
You cannot reach point (1, 1) until time 3.
When the depth of water is 3, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/29/swim2-grid-1.jpg" style="width: 404px; height: 405px;" />
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> grid = [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 16
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The final route is shown.
We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.
