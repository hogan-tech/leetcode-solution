2452. Words Within Two Edits of Dictionary</h2><hr><div><p>You are given two string arrays, <code>queries</code> and <code>dictionary</code>. All words in each array comprise of lowercase English letters and have the same length.</p>

<p>In one <strong>edit</strong> you can take a word from <code>queries</code>, and change any letter in it to any other letter. Find all words from <code>queries</code> that, after a <strong>maximum</strong> of two edits, equal some word from <code>dictionary</code>.</p>

<p>Return<em> a list of all words from </em><code>queries</code><em>, </em><em>that match with some word from </em><code>dictionary</code><em> after a maximum of <strong>two edits</strong></em>. Return the words in the <strong>same order</strong> they appear in <code>queries</code>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> queries = ["word","note","ants","wood"], dictionary = ["wood","joke","moat"]
<strong>Output:</strong> ["word","note","wood"]
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
- Changing the 'r' in "word" to 'o' allows it to equal the dictionary word "wood".
- Changing the 'n' to 'j' and the 't' to 'k' in "note" changes it to "joke".
- It would take more than 2 edits for "ants" to equal a dictionary word.
- "wood" can remain unchanged (0 edits) and match the corresponding dictionary word.
Thus, we return ["word","note","wood"].
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> queries = ["yes"], dictionary = ["not"]
<strong>Output:</strong> []
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
Applying any two edits to "yes" cannot make it equal to "not". Thus, we return an empty array.
