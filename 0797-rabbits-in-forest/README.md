<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/rabbits-in-forest">797. Rabbits in Forest</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><p>There is a forest with an unknown number of rabbits. We asked n rabbits <strong>&quot;How many rabbits have the same color as you?&quot;</strong> and collected the answers in an integer array <code>answers</code> where <code>answers[i]</code> is the answer of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> rabbit.</p>

<p>Given the array <code>answers</code>, return <em>the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> answers = [1,1,2]
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
The two rabbits that answered &quot;1&quot; could both be the same color, say red.
The rabbit that answered &quot;2&quot; can&#39;t be red or the answers would be inconsistent.
Say the rabbit that answered &quot;2&quot; was blue.
Then there should be 2 other blue rabbits in the forest that didn&#39;t answer into the array.
The smallest possible number of rabbits in the forest is therefore 5: 3 that answered plus 2 that didn&#39;t.
