<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-from-removing-stones">1879. Maximum Score From Removing Stones</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><p>You are playing a solitaire game with <strong>three piles</strong> of stones of sizes <code>a</code>​​​​​​, <code>b</code>,​​​​​​ and <code>c</code>​​​​​​ respectively. Each turn you choose two <strong>different non-empty </strong>piles, take one stone from each, and add <code>1</code> point to your score. The game stops when there are <strong>fewer than two non-empty</strong> piles (meaning there are no more available moves).</p>

<p>Given three integers <code>a</code>​​​​​, <code>b</code>,​​​​​ and <code>c</code>​​​​​, return <em>the</em> <strong><em>maximum</em> </strong><em><strong>score</strong> you can get.</em></p>

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> a = 2, b = 4, c = 6
<strong>Output:</strong> 6
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The starting state is (2, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 4, 5)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 4, 4)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)
There are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 6 points.

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> a = 4, b = 4, c = 6
<strong>Output:</strong> 7
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The starting state is (4, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:
- Take from 1st and 2nd piles, state is now (3, 3, 6)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (2, 3, 5)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 3, 4)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)
There are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 7 points.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> a = 1, b = 8, c = 8
<strong>Output:</strong> 8
<strong>Explanation:</strong> One optimal set of moves is to take from the 2nd and 3rd piles for 8 turns until they are empty.
After that, there are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends.
